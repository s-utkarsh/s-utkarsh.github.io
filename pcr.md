title: Lattice thermal conductivity using Phono3py and VASP
---

As part of my course project last semester, I had to investigate the use and functioning of Microreactors in Diagnostic applications. 
One of these uses is in a PCR unit, whose function is to multiply the DNA-sample in the drawn blood n-fold in order to successfully detect
diseases (those which directly affect DNA of the local region).

## How this is a analogous to a Chemical Engineering problem: 

Typically, when we encounter a problem of increasing an extensive property in our system, the approach is to simply scale up the process 
until a target value of that property is achieved.
