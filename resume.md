## Computer Skills

`VASP` - I learned it through my internship projects <br/>
`GROMACS` - Currently Working with GROMACS for my B.Tech thesis <br/>
`FPLO, Quantum Espresso, Wien2k` - Used these DFT solvers for some of my projects <br/>
`C++,Python & Bash Scripting` - Used in different segements for nearly all the work I do <br/>
`HTML, CSS, Javascript` - Work with these as part of my Sophmore proficiency project <br/>

## Research Projects

`August,2018 - Ongoing` **Multiscale Modelling of Polymeric Systems** <br/>
Dr. Prateek Kumar Jha, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Roorkee <br/>
As part of my final year project, I’m working on investigating Aggregation of a polymer as a
function of pH level of the system via. systematic course graining using the results of Atomistic level
simulations.

`September, 2018 - Ongoing` **Alkali metal based Alloys as High F.O.M. thermoelectrics** <br/>
Dr. Hem Chandra Kandpal, Department of Chemistry, IIT Roorkee <br/>
Thermoelectric investigation of Alkali metal based Heuslers where we use Wien2k, BoltzTraP and
Phono3py (with VASP) to calculate electronic, transport and thermal properties respectively.

`January - April, 2018` **CFD modelling of a PCR reaction using COMSOL-Multiphysics** <br/>
Dr. Prateek Kumar Jha, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Roorkee <br/>
With the aim to explore the use and functioning of Microreactors in Diagnostic applications as part
of the Process modelling and Simulation Course, one of which is in a PCR unit, whose function is to
divide and then Multiply DNA from blood samples. Used COMSOL to model the mass and momentum transfer through three stages of PCR.

`July - September, 2017` **Design of effecient materials for Photocatalytic Water Splitting** <br/>
Dr. Hem Chandra Kandpal, Department of Chemistry, IIT Roorkee <br/>
Our collaborators at IISER Mohali, India identified a stable ’Ta’ based material whose efficiency for
OER compares to some of the best materials reported for Water splitting. Our job was to explain
this on the basis of properties derived from the bandstructure of the material.

##  Extra-Curriculars

`2018-Present` **Undergraduate Teaching Assistant** <br/>
Physcial Chemistry (CY-001) - IIT Roorkee <br/>

`2017-2018` **General Secratary** <br/>
Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers (IIChE) Students’ Chapter - IIT Roorkee <br/>

`2015-2017` **Editor** <br/>
Watch Out! - Student Media Body - IIT Roorkee <br/>

## Community Service

**Volunteer, Rural Education Cell, National Service Scheme (NSS)- IITR** <br/>
Through this initiative, students in their freshman year teach young kids from surrounding villages
who can’t afford tutors and are lacking in basics or, are appearing for High-school examinations. <br/>

**Special Interest Group** <br/>
This is a small group some of us like minded people started to promote research among undergrads.
Common activities include lectures form peers on informative topics and industrial problem-solving
ranging from *Working of a mosquito repellent machine* to *How crypto-currency works*.
