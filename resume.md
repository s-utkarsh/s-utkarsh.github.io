## Computer Skills

`VASP` - I learned it through my internship projects <br/>
`GROMACS` - Currently Working with GROMACS for my B.Tech thesis <br/>
`FPLO, Quantum Espresso, Wien2k` - Used these DFT solvers for some of my projects <br/>
`C++,Python & Bash Scripting` - Used in different segements for nearly all the work I do <br/>
`HTML, CSS, Javascript` - Work with these as part of my Sophmore proficiency project <br/>

## Research Projects

`August,2018 - Ongoing` Multiscale Modelling of Polymeric Systems <br/>
Dr. Prateek Kumar Jha, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Roorkee <br/>
As part of my final year project, Iâ€™m working on investigating Aggregation of a polymer as a
function of pH level of the system via. systematic course graining using the results of Atomistic level
simulations.

`September, 2018 - Ongoing` Alkali metal based Alloys as High F.O.M. thermoelectrics <br/>
Dr. Hem Chandra Kandpal, Department of Chemistry, IIT Roorkee <br/>
Thermoelectric investigation of Alkali metal based Heuslers where we use Wien2k, BoltzTraP and
Phono3py (with VASP) to calculate electronic, transport and thermal properties respectively.
