You can look at some nifty guides, tips and tricks I learned while working on different projects involving different classes of Materials.

<h1><br>Lattice thermal conductivity using Phonon3py</br></h1>
Currently I'm working with some Alkali metal based Thermoelectric materials, where the lattice thermal conductivity has not been reported. There being no definitive guide to  calculating <b>&kappa;<sub>L</sub></b> using Phonon3py, here I list out common pitfalls and summarize the way to carry out calculatiions.</br>
